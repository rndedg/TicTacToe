# TicTacToe

I began this project as a means of practicing CSS and Javascript. It was created by following the tutorial found [here.](https://dev.to/bornasepic/pure-and-simple-tic-tac-toe-with-javascript-4pgn)

My future goals with this project are:
 - Nicer stylings, maybe some animations
 - Possible adding AI algorithms or online multiplayer
 - Win Streak counter
